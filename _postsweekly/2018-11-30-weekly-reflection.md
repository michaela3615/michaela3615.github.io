im going to discuss question 2 on the midterm test. the question asks what is the name of the outermost function in
```
(scale 2 (circle 40 "solid" "blue")
```
on the test I beleive i have chosen A and that was the right answer for the question because it was the farthest function for the center parenthesis.
the other majorty of people have chosen b. that answer was incorrect because circle was literally in the center funtion so it wouldn't make any sence since there was another set of parenthesis behind that one.
