```
(define gt(triangle size "solid" "green")
```
this function defines to form a triangle on your screen that is green that can be whatever size you want it to be.
The function is set up by a contract that tells what the function should become. The contract is
```
;gt: number-> image
```
this allows me to make triangles as big as the page or as small as a pixel.
