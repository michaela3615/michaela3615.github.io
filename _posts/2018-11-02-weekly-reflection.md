This weeks main idea in computer science was what are contracts and what are the parts to them. I learned that contracts are made up of many different parts like numbers, string, and images. they all have a role to play like the numbers can tell the size of the image and then string is a type of data that is surrounded in quotation marks that helps us use names for different functions like color that we know. For example, green, blue, red, and more. We also started learning about bitmap it helps us implement the images that we want into our game on wescheme.
